This repository contains the MATLAB code and data accompanying the paper, _A Tutorial on Identification of Subsynchronous Mode Frequencies in Power Transmission Systems using Parametric and Non-parametric Methods_, presented at the [2023 Texas Power and Energy Conference](https://tpec.engr.tamu.edu/).

The tutorial encompasses two cases: a single mode (unimodal) forced oscillation (case 1), and a multi-modal forced oscillation, labeled as case 2. Each of the `*.m` files uses a different observable among current, frequency, and voltage. The two different statistical techniques are:

- *Non-parametric method*: Welch-based power spectral density (PSD) estimation;
- *Parametric method*: output-based autoregressive (AR) model.

## Compatibility

The code in this repository was developed using MATLAB R2021b in Windows. It has been tested in the latest release as of this publication (R2022b).
